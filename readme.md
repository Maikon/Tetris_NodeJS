### Tetris tasks

* [Client-side] Add Bootstrap so the UI looks nicer
* [Client, server] Pause game (**finished**)
* [Server-side, logic] Increase the speed as the score increases (**finished**)
* [Client and server] Show the scoreboard on the main game web view (**in progress**)
- Add an API method that returns the score board JSON
- Load that JSON in jQuery and generate HTML for it
* [Client, SVG/D3] Show the "ghost" of where the current piece will fall
* [Client, server] Allow a key to be pressed to immediately make the piece drop down (**finished**)
* Your own feature: Powerups, multiplayer, etc.
